<h1>My First Blog!</h1>

<p>This is my first blog. a MVP (minimum viable product) if you would.</p>

<ol>
<li>Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?</li>
<li>What are you excited or eager to learn more about?</li>
<li>What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Well yes and no. I thought it would be a little easier. just because I've made a blog before. It was not because of markdown was introduced to me and gitpages.</li>
<li>I was really excited to play and learn more about gitpod. I've only used VS Code editor as a program not in a browser.</li>
<li>I love spiders! They are my spirit animal!</li>
