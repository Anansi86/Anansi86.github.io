3. What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?


## Answers

1. Well my first thoughts is how HTML is like a Car where you can put bumperstickers are words all over it (text, imgs, and other information). Css is to style the elements and make them look good and appealing. like paint or what the images look like. And Javascript is like the engine. The innerworkings behind how the car runs, or how the 
windows go up and down. 
2. I haven't done added any yet. I will be sure to next blog post.
3. Pseudocoding can be hard, but very interesting. You have to break down something, and figure out every step and how you would make it function. I must say I wanna be better at pseudocoding. I feel it's key!
