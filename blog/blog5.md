Blog 5 In-person Sprint - 1

Questions

1. What is the number one thing that held you back this week? Why?
2. What is one thing you would like to learn more about regarding JavaScript (JSON, Data Structures), Bootstrap, or Atomic Design?
3. How does In-Person Bootcamp compare to Remote Onboarding?
4. What is your “Why”?

Answers

1. Not asking for help was my biggest problem. I have it stuck in my head to not hold hands, so it slows me down.
2. I would like to have a better understanding of state. Also I'd like to get better at manipulating Bootstrap.
3. In-Person feels more lax. You can take an hour or two break. I guess the way to put it is in-home is more comfortable.
4. My "Why"? I guess I would have to say I want a better life. I'm tired of just surviving and getting by. I've done it all my
life, and I just want a career I can be proud of. It's really neat how I can create something out of nothing.
