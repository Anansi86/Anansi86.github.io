1. I wish I could make games. I want to be a video game devoloper one day.
2. Currently I'm struggling with some documentation. Like it doesn't click all the way for me. Something I've learned that I need to manage. I also have a problem just slowing down and going over everything bit by bit.
3. I try to research my problems. When it comes to code I research what I want to do and try to absorb it in and spit it back out.
4. Sometimes I just take a break, clear my head and just slow down my thinking.
