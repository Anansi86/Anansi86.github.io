# My First Blog!


### This is my first blog. a MVP (minimum viable product) if you would.

## Questions

1. Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?
2. What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
3. What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?

## Answers

1. Well yes and no. I thought it would be a little easier. just because I've made a blog before. It was not because of markdown was introduced to me and gitpages.
2. I was really excited to play and learn more about gitpod. I've only used VS Code editor as a program not in a browser.
3. I love spiders! They are my spirit animal!
